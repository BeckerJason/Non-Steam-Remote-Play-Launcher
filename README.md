## Steps
- Purchase and download a steam game that supports remote play (preferably one you dont want to play)
- Delete the EXE in the games folder and replace it with this EXE. Make sure to rename this EXE to match the old game name so steam thinks its launching the real game
- Launch this EXE once outside of steam so it can create a Configuration.json file
- Modify the JSON with the full path of the game you want to add Remote Play to (including .exe). Make sure there are only forward slashes in your path
- Launch game thru Steam
