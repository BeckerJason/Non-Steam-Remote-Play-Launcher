# Non-Steam-Remote-Play-Launcher
Used to Launch a non steam game thru steam and allow Remote Play Together.

## Steps
- Purchase and download a steam game that supports remote play (preferably one you dont want to play)
- Delete the EXE in the games folder and replace it with this EXE. Make sure to rename this EXE to match the old game name so steam thinks its launching the real game
- Launch this EXE once outside of steam so it can create a Configuration.json file
- Modify the JSON with the full path of the game you want to add Remote Play to (including .exe)
- Launch game thru Steam
